Compared to the initial algorithm (presented in chapter \ref{res:software}), the new spindles detection has several improvements. First, we implemented a data-driven tuning of the spindle frequency band by finding the peak spectral power within the sigma range. This step, initially described by \citet{berthomier_automatic_2007}, allows to accommodate for inter-individual variability of EEG signals, and is particularly useful when analyzing patients who tend to exhibit higher variability. Second, we now use both a hard and a soft threshold on the amplitude of the wavelet transform to determine more precisely the beginning and the end of each spindle. Finally, to allow users to better understand how the detection algorithm works, we implemented a function to plot the current figure for each desired time window.}

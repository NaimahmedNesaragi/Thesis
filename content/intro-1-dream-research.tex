\section{Dreams}
\label{sec:dream-research:dreams}

\subsection{Definition}
\label{sec:dream-research:dreams:definition}

Dreaming has fascinated mankind since the dawn of time. Surprisingly however, there is still no consensual and clear-cut definition for the word dreaming \citep{pagel_definitions_2001}. Rather, the definition of dreaming has evolved over the centuries along with the ever-growing understanding of its function and neurophysiological substrate. Believed to be messages from deities in ancient times (section \ref{sec:dream-func:history:ancient}), dreams were in turn seen as thoughts produced upon awakening in the nineteenth century (section \ref{sec:dream-research:link:goblot}), or as an epiphenomenom of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in the second half of the last century (section \ref{sec:dream-func:modern:nofunc}), to name but a few examples.

The present thesis is based on the working definition and model proposed by \citet{guenole_a_2009}. Based on experimental findings, Guénolé stated that \q{dreaming is a mental experience during sleep, which can be remembered and reported at wake} and proposed that the dreaming phenomenon can be distinguished into three successive and intertwined forms, namely the dream experience, the dream recall, and the dream report (Fig \ref{fig:intro:guenole}). These three forms are detailed as follow. First, the primordial state of dreaming is a mental experience that happens during sleep, although we still do not know precisely when (see section \ref{sec:dream-research:link}). Very little is known of the dream experience \emph{per se} because it is unobservable to the waking consciousness, be it that of an external observer, or that of the dreamer him- or herself. In order to become observable to the waking consciousness, dreams have to be remembered upon awakening, via the introspective recall of the dreamer (or \q{retrospection}, \citealp{schwartz_dreaming:_2005}). As a memory object, the recall is therefore likely to differ from the original dream experience due to possible forgetting, reconstruction and censorships mechanisms (\cite{schwartz_sleep_2002, schwartz_dreaming:_2005}). Finally, the last form is the transcription of the dream memory using either words or pictures, a process which leads once more to a potential loss of information because of description difficulties, censorships, shortening and modifications of the dream content. Still, most of the scientific research on dreaming has focused, de facto, on dream reports since it is the only form that is eligible to empirical investigation (in more poetic terms, \q{dreaming is a phenomenon that we can solely observe during its absence}, Paul Valery, Analecta, 1926)

\end{figure}

This impossibility to study the dream experience, using objective measures, while it is currently happening represents one of the greatest impediment to the understanding of the nature and function of dreaming. For that reason, dreaming still remains one of the great mystery of the human cognition. Do we dream during the whole night? If not, when and for how long? Why do we sometimes recall our dreams and sometimes not? To which extent do dream reports obtained after awakening accurately depict the mental experiences during sleep? What is, or what are, the function(s) of dreaming? What are the neurophysiological correlates of dream content and dream recall frequency? The aim of the present thesis is to offer a contribution to the ongoing effort to solve these questions.

\section{Sleep}
\label{sec:dream-research:sleep}

Although some authors have postulated that dreaming was not produced during sleep but at the moment of awakening (see section \ref{sec:dream-research:link:goblot}), this hypothesis has been since refuted and the scientific community now generally agree with Schopenhauer's aphorism that \q{the characteristic of dreaming is the condition of sleep peculiar to it}. Sleep is a reversible physiological and periodic state which is typically characterized by vigilance suspension, reduced interactions with surroundings, behavioral quiescence and closed eyes. According to the current dominant theory on sleep regulation, namely the \q{two-process model} \citep{borbely_two_1982}, sleep is under the influence of both circadian rhythms (humans are physiologically programmed to sleep at night) and homeostatic drive (the longer an individual remains awake, the sleepier he or she becomes).

Since prolonged sleep deprivation in animals reliably produces severe pathology and death \citep{rechtschaffen_physiological_1983, rechtschaffen_sleep_1989}, it is now well admitted that \q{sleep is the price we pay for being alive} \citep{tononi_sleep_2014}. Although the full extent of its function is unknown, sleep seems to be critically involved in the restoration of the immune system \citep{bryant_sick_2004}, thermo-regulation \citep{krueger_thermoregulation_1997}, emotional regulation \citep{goldstein_role_2014} and memory consolidation \citep{diekelmann_memory_2010}. Long regarded as an idle state, it is becoming increasingly evident that sleep is \q{first and foremost a brain process} \citep{hirshkowitz_normal_2004} in which the brain is \q{hard at work and helps makes something of the world}, to borrow the words of Heraclitus (for an exhaustive review of the cognitive processes occurring during sleep, see \citealp{andrillon_sleeping_2016}).

\subsection{Sleep stages}
\label{sec:dream-research:sleep:stages}

The invention of electro-encephalography (EEG) by Hans Berger in 1928 has paved the way for the scientific study of sleep. It was indeed soon after that discovery that Alfred Loomis first described a global slowing down of the brain rhythm during sleep, associated with the apparition of several grapho-elements such as K-complexes. Since then, sleep researchers have used EEG to monitor brain waves, electrooculography (EOG) to monitor eye movements and electromyography (EMG) to measure skeletal muscle activity. The simultaneous collection of these measurements is called polysomnography (PSG) and provides sufficient information to identify sleep stages according to standard international established guidelines. PSG is the gold standard in modern sleep science and is used in both clinical and research settings.

A first set of rules were published by Rechtschaffen and Kales (R\&K) in \citeyear{kales_manual_1968} and proposed to divide sleep into 5 stages with distinct electrophysiological properties, named rapid-eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) stages 1, 2, 3, 4. This nomenclature was updated in 2007 by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine \citep{iber_aasm_2007}. Sleep stages 3 and 4 were merged into a single stage, and the four remaining sleep stages were renamed as follow: REM, N1, N2, N3. Below are summarized EEG-EOG-EMG characteristics for wakefulness and the different sleep stages in healthy individuals  (\citealp{hirshkowitz_normal_2004, iber_aasm_2007}; see also Figure \ref{fig:intro:sleep_stage}).

\paragraph{Wakefulness}
Eyes-closed quiet wakefulness is accompanied by an EEG rhythm predominantly in the alpha range (8 - 12 Hz). Opening the eyes or engaging in a significant mental task (for example mental calculation) reduces or blocks the alpha activity. Fairly high muscle activity can be present and slow or rapid eye movements may occur.

\paragraph{N1 sleep}
Stage N1 corresponds to the transitional period between wakefulness and sleep. The brain rhythm progressively decreases from alpha to theta (5 – 7 Hz), and the EOG is characterized by slow waves corresponding to rolling eye movements. N1 sleep represents approximatively 5\% of a normal night of sleep.

\paragraph{N2 sleep}
Each night, we spend more than half of the night’s sleep in N2 sleep. The EEG activity during this stage is characterized by a predominance of theta waves, recurrently interrupted by two grapho-elements, the spindles and K-complexes, which are the landmarks of this sleep stage. K-complexes are defined as sharp negative waves followed by a positive component, prominent over frontal scalp electrodes and lasting more than 0.5 seconds. Spindles refer to burst of 11 to 16 Hz waves predominant over central scalp electrodes and lasting between 0.5 and 2 seconds. Beyond that, N2 sleep is characterized by an absence of eye movements as well as decreased muscle tone and brain metabolism.

\paragraph{N3 sleep}
N3 sleep, also referred to as deep sleep or slow-wave sleep, is characterized by a predominance (> 20\% of the 30-sec time window) of high amplitude (> 75 µV) delta waves (0.5 – 4 Hz). Eye motility, muscle tone and brain metabolism are even more decreased than in N2 sleep. N3 sleep represents approximatively 20\% of a normal night of sleep.

\paragraph{REM sleep}
As its name suggests, rapid eye movements (REM) sleep is characterized by rapid eye movements easily observable on the EOG channels. They consist of conjugate, irregular and sharply peaked eye movements, similar to some extent to those exhibited during wakefulness. Another fundamental aspect of REM sleep is the muscle atonia, revealed by a low EMG activity, which was discovered by Michel Jouvet in Lyon in 1959 (see section \ref{sec:dream-research:link:rem-sleep}). However, some transient muscle activity or muscle twitching (MTs) can also be observed. These short irregular bursts of EMG activity are superimposed on the background of low EMG activity. Brain metabolism is similar to that of wakefulness, and the EEG is marked by mixed low-amplitude waves predominantly in the theta band (saw-tooth waves), as well as a complete absence of delta rhythms. REM sleep is also accompanied by clitoris and penile erections \citep{fisher_cycle_1965, abel_womens_1979}. This sleep stage constitutes approximatively 20\% of a normal night of sleep.

\subsection{Sleep architecture}
\label{sec:dream-research:sleep:architecture}

A normal night of sleep consists of a repetition of four or five 90 to 110 minutes long cycles in which sleep stages follow each other in a specific order. The identification of sleep stages (a process called sleep scoring or sleep staging) is generally done visually by inspecting consecutive polysomnographic segments of 30 seconds. It results in a hypnogram which represents the succession of sleep stages across time (Fig \ref{fig:intro:hypno}). In his overview of the human sleep, \citet{hirshkowitz_normal_2004} described five generalizations about normal sleep architecture:

\begin{my_list_num}
    \item Sleep is entered through non-REM sleep
    \item Non-REM and REM sleep alternate approximately every 90 to 120 minutes
	\item N3 sleep predominates in the first third of the night
	\item REM sleep predominates in the last half of the night
	\item REM sleep occurs in four to six discrete episodes each night with episodes generally lengthening as sleep period progresses
\end{my_list_num}

% \subsection{Neurochemistry of REM and NREM sleep}
% \label{sec:dream-research:sleep:neurochemistry}
%
% The brain undergoes dramatic alterations in neurochemistry as it passes through the different sleep stages. NREM sleep is marked by a strong deactivation of subcortical cholinergic systems, and to some extent, a relative deactivation of aminergic systems (e.g. histamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine) compared to wakefulness. By contrast, REM sleep is characterized most notably by an abundance of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, combined with a nearly complete absence of aminergic modulation.

\section{Link between dreaming and sleep stages}
\label{sec:dream-research:link}

\subsection{Goblot's hypothesis}
\label{sec:dream-research:link:goblot}

\q{The dream, some said, is the thought of sleep. Has someone ever questioned the accuracy of this formula? I think it should be amended and rather say: \emph{the dream that one remembers is the thought of awakening}}. \footnote{Free translation from French: \q{Le rêve, à t-on dit, est la pensée du sommeil. A-t-on jamais songé à mettre en doute l'exactitude de cette formule? Je pense qu'il convient de la modifier, et de dire : \emph{Le rêve dont on se souvient est la pensée du réveil}}} It is with these words that \citet{goblot_souvenir_1896} start his article \q{Le souvenir des rêves}, which postulates that dreaming does not occur during sleep but only at the moment of awakening.

While this claim has enthralled several philosophers and neurobiologists in the twentieth century, numerous and robust experimental data in sleep psychophysiology clearly demonstrated that dreaming does take place during sleep (reviewed in \citealp{guenole_reve_2010}). Perhaps one of the most significant evidence against this claim is the scientifically-verified existence of lucid dreaming during REM sleep (i.e. the ability to become self aware of dreaming during a dream, see section \ref{sec:dream-research:attempts:ba-lucid}; \citealp{laberge_exploring_1991, dresler_neural_2012}), which clearly shows that dreaming (albeit a somewhat modified form of it) does occur during sleep. Other proofs against this hypothesis come from the study of parasomnias, such as sleep-talking or REM sleep behavior disorder, during which the dream content is (sometimes) correlated to the sleep behavior \citep{ellman_mind_1991, schenck_rem_2002, leclair-visonneau_eyes_2010}. Further evidence can be found by looking at the incorporation of non-awakening stimulations in subsequent dream reports. Using such a paradigm, \citet{dement_relation_1958} found that tactile (water) stimulation was incorporated 42\% of the time, and reported that the subjective time interval between the incorporation of the stimulus and the awakening was comparable within the dream and in waking-life.

\subsection{The REM sleep hypothesis of dreaming}
\label{sec:dream-research:link:rem-sleep}

In the early fifties, Nathaniel Kleitman and his doctoral student Eugene Aserinsky, discovered in humans the existence of periods of sleep with an EEG similar to wakefulness (low voltage and fast frequencies), rapid eye movements and neurovegetative responses \citep{aserinsky_regularly_1953}. This discovery had a strong and persistent impact on dream and sleep research. The authors have indeed proposed that the rapid eye movements corresponded to the scanning of dream images. They reached this conclusion by comparing the proportion of dream reports obtained upon awakening in periods of eye motility and outside these periods, respectively 75\% and 11\% in their 1953’s study, and 80\% and 7\% in their 1957's study \citep{dement_relation_1957}. They concluded that their newly-discovered REM sleep stage was the neurophysiological basis of dreaming. A few years later, the French neurophysiologist Michel Jouvet, who had started working on sleep in cats, found that REM sleep was associated with muscular atonia \citep{jouvet_sur_1959}, a finding that was soon after replicated in humans \citep{berger_tonus_1961}. Pursuing his research on REM sleep, or \q{paradoxical sleep} as he named it, Jouvet had the idea to suppress the muscular atonia by injuring the brain stem of cats. To his astonishment, he found that the injured cats were performing, during REM sleep, complex motor sequences, that he named \q{oneiric behavior} \citep{sastre_comportement_1979}. For him and the scientific community at the time, it was clear that these motors sequences were directly related to the cat's dreams, and this experiment provided a significant evidence in favor of the REM sleep hypothesis of dreaming.

However, even though equating dreaming with REM sleep provided a useful way to scientifically explore dreaming, it soon became apparent that dreaming was in fact not a specificity of REM sleep but also present during all the other sleep stages. Few years after the initial discovery of REM sleep, several researchers reported a much higher proportion of dream report in non-REM sleep than what was expected based on the findings of the Kleitman’s team \citep{goodenough_comparison_1959, foulkes_dream_1962}. \citet{goodenough_comparison_1959} found that, when awakened during NREM sleep, 17\% and 53\% of awakenings were associated with a dream report in individuals who never, or frequently, remembered their dreams, respectively. The recall rate went up to 54\% in Foulkes’s study which comprised 200 awakenings. Since then, numerous studies have replicated the finding of mentation outside of REM sleep \citep{nielsen_review_2000}, even in the periods of non-REM sleep located before the first nocturnal episode of REM sleep \citep{noreika_early-night_2009}. As a counterpoint, it has become apparent that a significant proportion of REM sleep awakenings were not followed by a dream report. Taken together, these results demonstrate that REM sleep is not the neurophysiological substrate of dreaming. It is noteworthy that this hypothesis is still predominant in the public mind, and to some extent in the scientific community. As Schwartz and colleagues aptly pointed out, \q{REM sleep is not a necessary, but a facilitating condition for dreaming to occur. Conversely, there is little doubt that dreaming was a necessary condition for REM sleep to become famous} \citep{schwartz_dreaming:_2005}.

\subsection{The fore-brain hypothesis of dreaming}
\label{sec:dream-research:link:solms}

Fervent supporter of the REM sleep hypothesis of dreaming, Allan Hobson argued that dreaming was generated by random neural signals originating within the brainstem during REM sleep (see section \ref{sec:dream-func:modern:nofunc}, \citealp{hobson_dream_1998}). His theory was the dominant view for several decades until Mark Solms refuted it using neuropsychological evidences. He examined 361 neurological patients and asked them in detail about their dream memories \citep{solms_neuropsychology_1997}. He found that out of 26 case reports of REM sleep loss or alteration following a lesion in the brainstem (Pons area), 25 were not associated with subsequent alterations in dream reporting. By contrast, he reported that in most cases global cessation of dream reporting (a condition referred to as the Charcot-Wilbrand syndrome) followed lesions in or near the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC; see Figure \ref{fig:intro:lesions}). Importantly, damage in these two regions were rarely associated with REM sleep disturbances. This double dissociation provides a clear argument that not only dreaming can occur outside of REM sleep, but it is also not dependent of the brainstem generators of REM sleep. This led Solms to put forward the fore-brain dream-on hypothesis of dreaming, according to which dreaming is initiated, and controlled by dopaminergic forebrain mechanisms involving at least the TPJ and the MPFC \citep{solms_dreaming_2000}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{A continuum of mentation during sleep}
\label{sec:dream-research:link:continuum}

Based on Solms’s findings, some authors have postulated that instead of relying on REM sleep mechanisms, dreaming might be best described along a continuum of mentation during sleep, ranging from the hypnagogic reveries typical of sleep onset to florid and vivid experiences often reported after awakening from REM sleep \citep{schwartz_dreaming:_2005}. A brief description of the different type of mental activities during sleep is reported in Table \ref{tab:intro:continuum}.

\section{Attempts to study the cerebral correlates of dreaming}
\label{sec:dream-research:attempts}

Thanks to the continuous advances in neuroimaging techniques, we have the means to measure, with unprecedented spatial and temporal accuracy, a bit of what is happening in the brain at a specific moment in time (see Methods section). Yet, since it is now well-accepted that dreaming can occur in all sleep stages, and because dream content is only accessible after awakening, it is therefore impossible to be sure that dreaming is happening at a specific time point during sleep. This conceptual issue has not prevented sleep and dream researchers to attempt to identify the cerebral correlates of dreaming. The main methods and findings are summarized in the following paragraphs.

\subsection{Brain activity during REM sleep}
\label{sec:dream-research:attempts:ba-rem}

On the basis of the REM sleep hypothesis of dreaming, which was predominant during the nineties, researchers used functional neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate the brain activity during REM sleep. They reported that, despite similarities between the wake and REM sleep electrophysiological scalp signals, the brain metabolism in these two vigilance states was different \citep{maquet_functional_1996, braun_regional_1997}. Among the most notable findings, the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was decreased in several brain regions including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and was increased in other regions (occipital, temporal, and superior parietal cortices, hippocampal formation, anterior cingulate and the pons). Following these works, researchers postulated that these changes in the brain functional organization could explain the phenomenological characteristics of dream reports \citep{hobson_dreaming_2000, schwartz_sleep_2002, maquet_human_2005, nir_dreaming_2010, ruby_experimental_2011}. For instance, increased occipital cortex activity during REM sleep could explain the clear predominance of visual modality in dream reports, a phenomenon that Vincent van Gogh had already noticed when he wrote: \q{I often think that the night is more alive and more richly colored than the day} (Vincent van Gogh, 1888). Second, the increased activity during REM sleep in the hippocampal formation, a region well-known for its role in memory encoding and retrieval, could account for the presence of known places and characters in dreams. Finally, the decreased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a region involved in executive function, cognitive control and working memory, could account for the lack of consistency, voluntary control and logical reasoning over the dream story. This is consistent with studies on lucid dreaming showing a partial reactivation of this area in lucid dreams compared to non-lucid dreams (see section below).

\subsection{Brain activity during lucid dreaming}
\label{sec:dream-research:attempts:ba-lucid}

Long considered as a fantasy, lucid dreaming - the ability to become self-aware of dreaming during a dream, and in some cases, to control the dream scenario – has recently gained considerable interest among researchers and the public. The scientific study of lucid dreaming started in the nineteenth century when Hervey de Saint Denys, a learned oneirologist, published in 1867 his landmark book \q{Dreams and the Ways to Direct Them: Practical Observations}, in which he described his own lucid dream experiences. More than a century later, more objective methods such as EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have become the technique of choice for investigating the cerebral correlates lucid dreams. Applying the method of pre-determined ocular signaling, developed by the pioneering lucid dreaming researcher Stephen Laberge (see \citealp{laberge_exploring_1991}), to fMRI, \citet{dresler_neural_2012} was remarkably able to measure, the brain activity during lucid REM sleep and non-lucid REM sleep (though only one subject out of four had lucid dreams of sufficient length). Lucid REM sleep was associated with a reactivation of areas that are normally deactivated during REM sleep, such as bilateral precuneous, parietal lobules and prefrontal and occipito-temporal cortices. Phenomenologically, these regions are either involved in self-awareness and executive functions, and their reactivation during lucid dreaming could account for the resurgence of a certain level of self-awareness and voluntary control. Even more recently, \citet{voss_induction_2014} was able to induce an increased level of self-reflective awareness during dreaming using fronto-temporal transcranial alternating current stimulation. Consistent with their previous EEG results \citep{voss_lucid_2009}, the authors reported that increased lucidity was most prominent during stimulation in the lower gamma band. However, the lucidity was not assessed directly by the dreamer but assumed a posteriori if the subjects reported elevated ratings on a lucidity scale. In conclusion, while lucid dreaming seems to provide an appealing and elegant way to study the dreaming brain, one should keep in mind that the inherent problem with this method lies precisely in the fact that lucid dreams are, by nature, different from non-lucid dreams. As exciting as the results are, it would be however difficult to generalize them to the research on non-lucid dreams (in addition with the fact that lucid dreams are difficult to obtain under laboratory conditions).

\subsection{Brain activity in the minutes preceding a dream report}
\label{sec:dream-research:attempts:ba-pre}

Another line of research consists in comparing the pre-awakening sleep EEG spectral power associated with the presence or absence of a dream report. This paradigm has been used in several studies over the years, the findings of which are summarized in Table \ref{tab:intro:ba-pre}. \citet{esposito_reduced_2004} reported that in both REM and N2 sleep, dream recall was associated with a lower alpha and delta power in the 3 minutes preceding awakening. According to the authors, the alpha effect may reflect increased cognitive elaboration and visual imagery as well as increased attention and memory processes. \citet{marzano_recalling_2011} found that dream recall after morning awakening from REM sleep was associated with a higher frontal 5–7 Hz (theta) activity in the 5 minutes preceding awakening. In N2 sleep, dream recall was associated with a decrease in alpha power, an observation consistent with Esposito’s results. The same year, another study reported a lower delta power for the dream recall condition following awakening from N2 sleep, and a higher alpha and beta power in occipital derivations for REM sleep \citep{chellappa_cortical_2011}. Finally, a recent study reported that in both N2 and REM sleep, dream recall was associated with local decreases in delta power in posterior cortical regions in the 2 minutes preceding awakening \citep{siclari_neural_2017}. The authors were able to predict whether an individual reported dreaming or the absence of dream experiences after awakening from N2 sleep by monitoring this posterior ‘hot zone’ in real time. However, it should be noted that the authors did not cite the numerous previous studies using the same methodology, and did not as a consequence discuss their findings in comparison to previous ones. This is regrettable given the great heterogeneity, and even contradiction, in the results of all these studies. Furthermore, there are two major issues with this methodology. First, we can never be sure whether the dream actually took place in the minutes just before awakening or several tens of minutes before. Second, as we already pointed out, it is impossible to know for sure whether the failure to recall a dream actually means that the sleeper was not dreaming, or rather that the sleeper was dreaming but did not remember it. In this view, one can assume that rather than looking at the cerebral correlates of dreaming, these studies in fact investigated the cerebral correlates of dream recall.

\subsection{Dreaming as a subsystem of the default mode network}
\label{sec:dream-research:attempts:dmn}

The past few years have witnessed the emergence of a new conceptual framework of dreaming, centered on the idea that dreaming is a form of mind-wandering, whose cerebral correlates are a subsystem of the default mode network (DMN; see Methods section; \citealp{maquet_human_2005, domhoff_neural_2011, domhoff_dreaming_2015, christoff_mind-wandering_2016}). Based on the fact that dreaming and waking spontaneous thought share many features (i.e. predominance of the audiovisual modalities, centered on one’s current goals and concerns, draw heavily on semantic and episodic memory in constructing simulations and future plans, presence of a wide range of affect), some authors have postulated that dreaming is a \q{type of spontaneous thought that is highly unconstrained, hyper-associative and highly immersive} \citep{christoff_mind-wandering_2016}. Using the results of lesion and REM sleep neuroimaging studies, they argued that dreaming should be accompanied, at the neural level, by a strong recruitment of the default mode network medial temporal lobe (MTL)-centered subsystem and strong deactivations in frontoparietal control network regions (such as the DLPFC). Activation of the former areas could be related to the generation of spontaneous thoughts, during both wake and sleep, while the deactivation of the latter areas could explain the high volatility and variability of dream content over time. However, this theoretical framework remains to be experimentally tested and validated.

\subsection{Limitations}
\label{sec:dream-research:attempts:limitations}

Several methodologies and frameworks have been proposed over the years to decipher the neurophysiological correlates of dreaming. However, while the findings of these studies may shed light on specific aspects of the dreaming phenomenon (e.g. REM sleep dreaming, lucid dreaming, dream recall), they usually do not encompass and explain the wide spectrum of dreaming-related mental activities during sleep. For instance, if the phenomenological characteristics of dream reports are related to the REM sleep brain functional organization, and given that NREM and REM sleep are very different at the neurophysiological level, how then do we explain that a non-negligible proportion of NREM dream reports are \q{indistinguishable by any criterion from those obtained from post-REM awakenings} \citep{hobson_dreaming_1988}?
